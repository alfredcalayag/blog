Hi there. My blog is meant to open-source some of my life experiences.  I talk tech, I talk life.   You'll find that it contains a range of non-related topics and non-related topics that I manipulate into becoming related.  It's all meant to be a sharing information and ideas, and I intend this to be fun.

Visit my main site and learn more about me at [alfredcalayag.com](http://alfredcalayag.com).

Thanks for stopping by.
