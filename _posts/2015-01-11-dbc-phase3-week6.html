<p>Phase 2 is done, and it feels like the 2-week break didn't even exist.  I got so burned out this past week, but I didn't go down without a fight.</p>
<p>I learned how to connect to an API to request for some data, and then do magical something with it.  Github's API had some nice documentation and was a pleasure to use.  The HTTParty gem makes it a breeze to use.  I also learned how to create an API... turns out, it's like an app without a view.</p>
<p> I incorporated this directly to my P10 project (i.e. Phase 2 final personal project).  I still have much work to do before it can be presentable, but I have every intention to push it to Heroku and make it public.  Realistically, it won't be until after DBC graduation.  Stay tuned for that!</p>
<p>I learned how OAuthorization works... that thing that some websites do at their login that says, "Sign In using your Facebook Account" or Gmail account or whatever.  It's basically passing off the authentication process to those guys rather than doing it yourself.  So, if you don't mind putting dependencies with them this could be a preferrable login choice.  I've the pros and cons about using it.  I don't have any personal preference as of yet.</p>
<p>We learned about 'background jobs'.  In a nutshell, it offshores some of your tasks to multiple servers so that effectively, your app doesn't slow down.  I wish I had learned about this earlier because it was very related to what I was trying to do in my P10.  So I had a day to play around with Redis server, Sidekiq to create workers, and Clockwork to schedule the worker tasks.  Very cool stuff.  You know how you get that notification email from your bank when your statements are ready...on the same day of the same month... likely a scheduled background job.</p>

<p>Finally, another cohort graduates as they do every 3 weeks at DBC.  The vast majority of the final projects consisted of... wait for it... NOT USING A RAILS Framework.  How awesome is that.  Learn Rails at DBC, and then push the limit to learn other frameworks and use that instead?  Granted, they may have had some more time given the 2 week-break, they were all impressive.  I felt so inspired how much they've accomplished in such a small amount of time.  I feel the urge to the same and keep pushing the bar.  At the same time, I feel that implicitly... is this naturally the direction for DBC?</p>

<p>I took some much a needed RESTful route... some good 'ol fashion sleep. Get ready, because I have arrived to the final Phase 3. Let's get dirty.</p>

<p>We're gonna do Rails.. Then we're gonna learn Angular.  Then we're gonna learn Backbone, and Node.  And Ember.  Then we're gonna do iOS.  Then Android.  And then we're gonna go to Devbootcamp to finish our final project and...</p>
