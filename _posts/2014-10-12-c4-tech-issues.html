<p>Phase 0, Week 4<p>

<p>Today marks the last day of <a href="http://www.fleetweek.us/">Fleet Week</a> in San Francisco.  Will you be looking up at the sky to witness the Blue Angels with your very own eyes or through your phone as you capture some amazing photos?  Will you be looking down checking-in your location on facebook?  Are you texting your friends to meet you by the seals? Are you walking around and orienting yourself with your map application?  Hey George, watch out for that tree!</p>

<p>"Walking and texting" or "distracted walking" is a problem.  Not just 'texting', but walking and doing <i>anything</i> on the phone for that matter. Have we become that impatient that we can't spare a moment to put away our phones? We are so zoned in to that tiny little screen that we are ignoring the world around us and it's crippling us in the process. I, myself, have been guilty as charged. At times you may catch me phone-handed, but I'm far from the only one.</p>

<p>You can find several YouTube videos of texting while walking accidents. To share a few, check out this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl0JojWH1rQ">ABC News video</a> and a couple of my favorites from Stanley Roberts (Kron4 News) - People Behaving Badly: <a href="http://news.kron4.com/features/people-behaving-badly-video-electronic-zombies/">Electronic Zombies</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVrM3mX3aFo">Texting and Walking</a>.  Yes, us smartphone walkers are now being compared to walking zombies. </p>

<p>The videos give off an American's Funniest Home Video feeling so while I do find them funny in nature, the issue is very serious.  I sure don't want to be that guy in a surprise confrontation with a bear. (I want to confront the bear when I'm ready and on my terms).  While these videos don't get overly graphic, you can imagine people walking into bicyclists and worse, cars.  Even if not you directly, you could cause someone to swerve out of the way and indirectly create an accident.  Aside from accidents you do put a target on yourself for those lurking to snatch one.  Hey dude, it's a $300 device ripe for the picking and you're waving it around.  Even worse than a snatch-and-run, you could get mugged.  I agree with you, none of these situations are desirable.</p>

<p>According to this <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/30/texting-while-walking_n_1717864.html">huffingtonpost article</a> back in 2011, there were 1,152 people in the U.S. were treated in the emergency room due to injuries from walking while on an electronic device.  Now think about the rising number of smartphone and tablet users since then.  <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/">Pewinternet.org</a>estimates that 90% of American adults own a cell phone and 56% of American adults use a smartphone. More smart phone users.  More walkers. (BTW, I'm excited for tonight's first Season 4 episode of The Walking Dead.)</p>

<p>Some of the news reports suggest that local laws may start to get implemented as a means to reduce the number of texter-walkers.  "I got a ticket for walking-while-texting."  Sounds a little silly, doesn't it?  And I'd be embarrassed to mention it to my friends. Creating a new law is one way to discourage this behavior, but look at the results of texting-while-driving law.  It will help, but there's still more work to be done.</p>

<p>I personally think that there needs to be new education on the use of smartphones, the do's and don't's, the etiquette in public, professional, and social environments, and walking while smartphoning being just one aspect of it.  As smartphones are quickly being adopted, and I haven't heard anyone stop to define what's okay and what's not okay.  Rather, what has been <i>acceptable</i> has been been implied and it's not all that clear.  As far as walking goes, I suggest to go back to the fundamental look both ways before crossing the street.  When did that stop applying to us?  Overall, practice your street smarts.  Simply, don't walk and use your smartphone at the same time.  If you need to, stop walking, do what you need to do on the phone, then put it away and continue walking.  If you're walking through a questionable area, keep your phone in your pocket or at the very least try to be as discrete as possible if you need to whip it out.  You wouldn't go walking around with wads of cash in your hand, would you?  So don't do it with your phone. <i>end of rant</i></p>

<p>Just because we <i>can</i> use it anywhere and anytime, it doesn't mean we should.  I'm concerned for your safety.  Please take caution before you end up playing Frogger while playing <a href="http://www.play-frogger.com/">Frogger</a>.  Flappybird can wait.  Candycrush can wait.  The email/text/post/check-in/hashtag/tweet/gitpush can wait. <b>It can wait.</b> <i>(For DBC'ers maybe gitpush can't wait if it's Sunday 11:58pm)</i></p>

<p>Now that you've managed to keep your phone in your pocket, let's fix the next problem: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/07/29/5.inch.dell.streak/"><b>THE PANT BULGE</b></a>.</p>
