      </p>

  <p>In my preparation to applying for a coding bootcamp, I came across <a href="http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby"> Test First Ruby</a> (I see the site has been down for a while).  As I am approaching the end of Phase 0 at DBC, TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD) has showed up on many occasions. As a newbie in coding, the idea seemed strange.</p>

  <center><p><i>Run your program first.  See all the tests fail.</i></p></center>

  <p>I'm being set up for failure? Of course, they would all fail.  I haven't written anything yet, and I'm running a blank file.</p>

  <center><p><i>Now write a little bit of code, just enough, to make the first test pass.  Once that is passing, write a little more code to make the next test pass.  And so on and so forth until all tests are passing.</i></p></center>

  <p>I found this to be a great way to train my eyes and understand how to read error codes.  With practice, writing code based on tests became natural and I was coding faster and faster.  It gave me confidence that I am coding in the right direction.  Obviously, if I strayed away in the wrong direction I would be halted by the failing test spec.</p>

  <p>My fun with it:
    <ul>
      <li>Feels more like a game, rather than work.</li>
      <li>Instant feedback.  For every little bit of code, you'll quickly learn if it solved the test condition.</li>
      <li>Helped me learn how to read error codes.</li>
      <li>A very specific guidance in writing code.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Frustrations and other thoughts:
    <ul>
      <li>When my code is continually failing a test. *grrr..*</li>
      <li>When the tests could be TOO specific.  You must know that the test is expecting a verbatim result.  Any deviating result you come up with will be a failure no matter how close you are. </li>
      <li>I feel like I'm not thinking as much... perhaps not being as creative.  I feel like I can write code just to make all the tests pass and not know what the overall program is doing.</li>
      <li>I'm relying too much on the tests to guide me.  What would I do if the tests weren't there?</li>
      <li>Should this take a way from pseudocode?  I can't imagine writing pseudocode first, because I'll have to run, fail, and write anyway.  Perhaps writing pseudocode afterward to provide any necessary explanations. </li>
      <li>If I were to write the test code, this feels like it would be about double the amount of code that needed to be written:  test code and the code itself.  Thinking of cost vs. value.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>I do wonder how all you developers out there use TDD.  From the small startups to large established companies.  How much is it used, emphasized, and valued?  I am a myself a developer in development, so I am curious how much TDD is used (if at all) in your work.</p>

 <p>Finally...</p>
