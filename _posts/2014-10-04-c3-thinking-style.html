<p>Phase 0, Week 3</p>
<p>...but my thoughts are telling me yes. (not everyone will get that one). This week at DBC, we are reflecting on our thinking styles as a way to understand how it can be used to our advantage in learning new material yet to come.</p>

<p><!--Research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn.-->
Based on the <a href = "http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>, I found something very interesting: I don't readily identify with any one thinking style.  In taking the thinking style quiz, I scored evenly across the board as a Concrete Sequential, Abstract Random, and Concrete Random.  Great, am I a weirdo? or Does that mean I can be all of these at the same time?  I think what this tells me is that I may have different thinking styles depending on the situation at hand.  If I were to describe myself, I'd say that I'm adaptable.  I think I can take advantage of this at DBC by tuning my thinking style to one or the other depending on the assignment/project and whether a solo challenge, partner, or team challenge.  Maybe I can play the best of all worlds?

<p><!--Reflect on your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.-->
It's been almost 3 weeks so far in Phase0 at DBC.  The biggest struggle for me so far has been organizing all of the information and to-do assignments and gauging how much time it will take. The next biggest struggle has then been juggling the DBC work with the rest of my life.  Overall, I do feel a little unorganized and just not knowing where to start (like cleaning up my messy room).  Like many things, I say that the hardest part is always the beginning.  I don't yet have a vision for the amount of work to expect.  My plan is to keep my feelers on and adjust accordingly.  Scheduling seems to be more critical now, since I have to schedule everything on my own.  I think time-boxing will definitely help in managing my time.  At the same time, I want to keep a balance of "getting the work done" vs. really understanding the stuff.  I'm not here to just get by, I'm trying to fly. =)

<!--Now, contemplate the idea of [growth vs. fixed mindset](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/). Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.-->
I really really really hope I can maintain a <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth mindset</a>. I think it is critical to go in to a program such as DBC to keep an open mind and willing to take on new challenges and not shy away.  I am expecting an accelerated program with A LOT of information cramming in a matter of a few months.  How to embrace it all?  In week 2, learning CSS was brand new to me and it took me a long time to finally understand some of the concepts (and still a work in progress).  But I find it fun and continue to find it a rewarding experience in adding more elements to my website.  I'm looking forward to doing even more.  I hope throughout the program I continue to have the same approach and attitude to the many many more new things to come.  It's those general ideas that I will try to implement:  Keep an open mind, Take the risk, and Don't be afraid to fail.
