<p>Phase 0, Week 6 - </p>

<p>My name is called.  I walk to my designated mat number.  I glance over at my opponent at the opposite side as I pace back and forth.  I'm quivering as I wait to be called to enter.  My heart is beating faster and faster. He's younger.  He's faster.  He's stronger.  He's been training longer than I have.  I'm nervous. I am scared. I could pass out from a choke.  I could be walking away limping. Could be a broken arm.  These are some serious risks that I'm taking.</p>
<p>A thousand of these thoughts shoot through my head as anxiously await to fight my first match.  I have every reason to fear.  I am weaker, I will lose.  I am slower, I will lose.  I am not as experienced, I will lose.  For everything that makes up who I am, I can have every reason to fail. But should it stop me?</p>
<p>The real fight is not with the person in front of me.  The real fight is with myself in channeling my energy to "How will I succeed?" rather than focusing on how I will fail.</p>

<p>While this situation and associated feelings are very literal, I also like to use it in the figurative sense and apply it to the other aspects in life.  It came to my mind as I learned about <b>"stereotype threat"</b> which is <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">defined</a> as <b>"risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group."</b>  While my obvious response would be to think of situations about my race, I'd like to take a different approach. A more positive approach. And that approach is to... embrace the risk.</p>

<p>You see, I am comfortable with who I am. And I want to say that I know myself pretty well.  I am conscious of how I see myself and how others may see me.  I am happy. I am proud of my strengths and I embrace my weaknesses. I understand my disadvantages.  I try not to bring race into the picture when thinking of my disadvantages, but in some cases it is inevitable. Again, I ask, should this be enough to stop me?
</p>
<p>The approach is very much how I deal with stereotype threats. Accept it, it exists. I am pre-disposed to a certain stereotype.  It is who I am belonging to a particular "group".  Understand it. Focus on how I will overcome it.  Understand the risk.Take the risk.  Perhaps I will fail and confirm my stereotype.  But should it stop me from giving it my all?  If I do not try, I will never know.  If I try, there is a chance I may succeed.  I can fail and try try again.  But, if I never take the risk, there is statistically ZERO chance that I will ever make it.</p>

<p>I finally get called to enter.  Bow to the referee and to my opponent as a sign of respect. Am I scared? Yes. But I cannot let the fear stop me from reaching my potential.  I must fight the anxiety. I must take the risk to realize the reward. My friends, if we will ever win, we must fight!</p>
