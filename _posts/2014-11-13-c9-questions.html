<p>Phase 0, Week 9 - Any Questions?</p>

<p>Huh? What?  When posting a question on an online forum or group page, isn't it always nice to receive the answer that you are looking for?  It goes both ways, my friend.  It takes 2 to tango.  For you to receive a good answer, you must pose a good question.  So what makes a good question? <i>(was that a good question itself?)</i> Here are some tips to help you when you're seeking that help.</p>

<p>They say that the most powerful form of communication is <a href="http://humanresources.about.com/od/interpersonalcommunicatio1/a/nonverbal_com.htm">non-verbal</a> (body language).  I guess this means that when communicating through text or email online, we are missing those powerful elements and face the challenges of mis-interpretation.  ALL CAPS => are you yelling?  See text interpretation has the potential to creating war between best friends: </p>

<div id="code_block">
  <code>
    # What makes a good question:<br><br>

    def good_question?<br>
    &nbsp if context_defined<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &amp&amp scope_defined<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &amp&amp specific<br>
      &nbsp &nbsp &amp&amp at_the_right_place?<br>

    &nbsp return true<br>
    end
  </code>
</div>

<p><b>Define the scope</b>. It's good to lay out the background of where you currently stand in asking your question. Are you looking for a simple yes or no answer?  How much detail do you want?</p>
</p>

<p><b>Specific</b>.  General questions generates general answers.  The more you narrow it down the better.  What language are you coding in?  What tools are you using?  What result are you trying to achieve? Give an example of the result. What have you tried so far and what results are you observing?
</p>

<p><b>Proofread.</b>  'Your' and 'You're' mean 2 different things. Before hitting that submit button, read what you just wrote.  Ask yourself if it is clear.  Imagine how others might respond to it.  Go back and do some revisions if you feel it can benefit from a refactor.</p>

<p><b>Ask in the right place</b>.  In other words, don't ask at the wrong place.  There are several places to post your question.  For it to receive th e attention it deserves, take the time study the forum to find the best category it belongs to.  Posting your question in the right place will also help others understand the scope of the question.</p>

<p>One final tip:  Google Search if it's already been asked.  If you're troubleshooting an error code, copy and paste the error into your search.  You may find your answer quicker this way instead of asking yourself and wait.  If not, use some of the search results to help you get some new ideas of how to continue searching for it.  And finally, if you determine that your question is unique, it is time to post your question.</p>
