<p>Phase 0, Week 8</p>

<p>Conflicts are unavoidable.  How do you respond to them?  Is it similar to Mary Katherine Gallagher in the video below?  In this blog, I'll share a short story about one incident I had and my thoughts about it in hindsight.</p>

<p>
Back in college, I worked on a project with a friend.  It was a big project that spanned over 6 months and at the end, we were looking forward to a big presentation of some 100's of people.  There were a lot of moving pieces, but ultimately our job was managing to get it all put together by the deadline.  In other words, it was on US if something didn't go right.  Huge weight on our shoulders. You get the picture.
</p>

<p>We were friends, so we didn't want to be too serious/business-like when it came to the work.  We wanted to have fun when getting the work.  Sound like a good plan?
</p>
<p>
Yes, at first... but it was more like having no plan. In some areas, we were lacking specificity (even a word?).  We laid out all of the large and small tasks, and maybe had some assumed items in our heads, but we didn't do a good job of assigning these responsibilities.  "This is what we need to get done... we'll get it done", is what we said without further detail.  In some ways, the looseness was fun.  In some ways, things did get done.  But in other ways, the lack of planning gradually built up a freakish nervousness inside of me.
</p>
<p>Deadlines started approaching, and in my head were a lot of parts in danger of not meeting their goals.   Why am I the only one stressing out?  Why do I feel like I'm doing all of the work?  Where is my partner?  Why does it always have to be me to bring up these important things?</p>
<p>I just had it.  You, me, right now.  We're gonna have this talk, and you're gonna get it.</p>

<p>All of my frustration and anger bottled up exploded and it was raining harsh words.  No violence, but I let it all out.  Basically, how we're supposed to be a team and you're not holding up your end of the bargain.  It was an uncomfortable conversation, and very one-sided with me yelling my partner's ear off.  For most of the conversation, my partner wouldn't even look at me in the face.</p>
<p>At the end of it, having that conversation DID make the conflict better.  We both got to air out our laundry, and listen to each other and were able to be more compassionate about each other's feelings.  We found an understanding.  While it sure made situation better, I just wish it didn't have to get to that point.  Especially because this had a potential of damaging a friendship.
</p>
<p>If I could go back, there were many things that I could have improved.  I would definitely change our initial approach.  I would focus more on regular checking in with my partner.  Although friends, we probably should not have escaped the reality of when it comes to business, we need to mean business.  Perhaps, there was a lack of understanding in our styles of work, and we both could have benefitted from taking the time to learn more about each other in that sense.</p>
<p>This experience helped me learn more about myself and reminder that everyone works differently.  There are consequences both in being quiet and consequences in being vocal.  No one is immune to consequences.  In collaborative efforts, there is a tremendous value in maintaining good communication.  Also, if you're able to go through a conflict and still manage to be friends, you probably have a great friend.</p>

<p>DBC shared an article, <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">Compass of Shame</a>, which talks about some of the default ways people repsond to conflict situations.  In reflection of my story, I hit 2 points, going from 'Withdrawal'(avoiding the conflict) and then 'Attack Other' (when I couldn't keep it bottled in anymore).  Just an interesting observation that there is this scientific explanation to it.
</p>
<p>I was happy to find that the article mentioned an alternative approach to shame.  Specifically, <b>humility</b>.  I find this to be very helpful for myself today. Being comfortable with who I am, in my strengths just as much as my weaknesses.  Being truthful with nothing (relevant) to hide. Being comfortable to expose my weaknesses and crack jokes about myself, not to fuel destruction to my self-esteem, but in a playful light-hearted manner that opens up myself to create welcoming environment for others to do open up the same way without fear of being put into shame. It is what it is.  I am who I am.  We all have room for improvement, but we can love ourselves wholeheartedly every step of the way.  Humility.  Boom.</p>
