<p>Phase 0, Week 1</p>

<p>In this week of phase0, I learned the basic concepts around version control and specifically using git and Github as a solution.  As a quick and dirty explanation, 'git' is the local version control manager and "Github" is the sort of 'cloud' or 'remote' version control manager.  Git helps keep track of changes by doing all the work for you, i.e. instead of you manually re-naming a file v.1, v.1.1, v.1.2. etc., it does that but also help note what specifically was changed.</p>

<p>As I enter the realm of coding, up ahead of me are paired coding exercises and eventually group projects that will require several people working on the same project or even the same document simultaneously.  You see the problem, right?  So Github being the "remote" file version manager, it is a great tool to store code there for the aforementioned situations.</p>
