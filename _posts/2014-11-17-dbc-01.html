<p>DBC - Phase 1, Day 1</p>
<p>I started my morning train ride into the city and felt like, "Today marks the first day of my transformation".  At night, I hop on my roundtrip, thinking, "How am I going to do all of this?"</p>

<p>If I could take away one thing from today is the way to learn.  Repeatedly, I heard Sherif, our phase 1 instructor, pound us with the idea NOT to do the assignments simply to check off a box.  This is not a checklist of items to learn to feel good about yourself and be done with it.  Did you really learn the key learning competencies? Or did you finish the challenge just to finish?</p>
<p>It's the bad habits that we adopt from tradional schooling.  In that environment, our objective was to complete assignments and complete the next assignment.  If you didn't finish, you fail, whether you learned anything or not.  DBC isn't handing out letter grades here.  At the end of the day, what we will have is what we learned. It's not about how many challenges we finish.  It's about did you really learn the material?</p>
<p>While I'm all aboard on that ship, I found very recently in my pairing session that it was difficult to break this habit.  It was natural for me to focus more on finishing the challenge rather than the learning objectives.  It's going to take more of a concscious effort than I initially thought.</p>
<p>The other bad part about worrying over finishing a challenge is the value you gain from the time spent.  If you become to narrowly focused on 'finishing', but it's taking hours on end, you may have benefitted more from starting out other new challenges.  If you feel that you've learned enough of about the objectives, it may be a good idea to stop there and move on. Make a conscious effort to finish, but don't let it be your downfall.  These ideas were also echoed by the 'coaches' (graduate DBC'ers).</p>

<p>Don't focus on the job search right now.  Focus on learning the material.  Don't be afraid to repeat a phase.  Consider repeating a phase as another FREE 3 weeks at DBC.  Apparently, Phase 2 seems to be the one to repeat.

Other mentionable notes:
<ul>
  <li>If you finish the challenge fast, go around and help others struggling.  Someone might have a different approach to solving the problem, and YOU might not understand their approach.  That would be another opportunity to learn.</li>
  <li>Learn the keyboard shortcuts.  About 95% of all stuff you need to do can be done on the keyboard.  You don't really need a mouse.</li>
  <li>Skim through the reading material first, brushing across the table of contents.  Do this first.  Then dive in to the areas necessary.  There's only so much time to read so much material.  Go through 1 book a day.
  </li>
  <li>Timebox.  Mandatory breaks!</li>
  <li>Stuck on a problem? Take care of your basic needs first. Did I eat? Did I poop? Did I step away from the computer?</li>
