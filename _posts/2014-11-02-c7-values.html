<p>Phase 0, Week 7</p>

<p><b>Health, Integrity, Patience, and Persistence</b>.  These are the key values I fall on when</p>
<p><center><code> it.hits_the_fan</code></center></p>
<p>(Do you like my choice of variable and method names?)</p>
<p>If I were to highlight one, it would be <b>health</b>.  Before I can start, during the middle, and at the end, it has been my base.  Compromising my health is a break in my balance, and it means everything else falls out of place a lot easier. I must be in good health before I can get up and enjoy just about anything. Not only physical health, but emotional health, psycological health, and spiritual health.  If I'm hurting in any one of these areas, it could very well create a block or a wall preventing me from focusing on anything I would like to get done.  That has happened many times before.  On the bright side, being in excellent standing with my health I feel a natural high and feel like nothing is impossible.</p>

<p><b>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</b></p>
<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, here's how I would rate each on how much I try to live up to these values.</p>
<p>Health: 5 </p>
<p>Integrity: 5</p>
<p>Patience: 5</p>
<p>Persistence: 5
<p>A perfect score! And that's to no surprise.  Anything less, I probably would not be writing about it here. When I lock down on my target, I try to give it 100%.  Go figure.</p>

<p>These values play a big role in most advice that I give.  The last topic that someone asked me for advice was about life and career choices.  It's been a hot topic in my life as of recently, and that makes sense.  I'm 30, I left my job I've been working at for 7 years, and now pursuing a career completely different.  I've been flooded with the who, what, when, where, and why?  What I learned was there are many others thinking about themselves regarding these big life decisions that I made.  We're all coming from different backgrounds so the specifics would change per the individual, but I believe the same fundamental piece of advice can apply to everyone.  That is: Figure out what truly makes you happy and pursue it.  Start today.  Start now.  Don't waste another moment.  If you're not happy with where you are at right now, why are you there?  Life is too short to live unhappily.  Ask yourself, what is holding you back from realizing your dreams today?  It's not going to be easy, but you'll never get there if you don't try. Be truthful to yourself.  Be good to yourself.  You deserve it.  Maintain your good <b>health</b>.</p>

<p>When I think about my values, I feel empowered and I think it can help mediate stereotype threats if I start to feel them at DBC.  They will bring me back to earth when I start to fly off into the dangerous space of 'I can't do it.'  Relax, and take a deep breath.  Yes, there will be some challenging situations and THIS IS NORMAL.  Specifically, this is how I see myself coaching myself through those rough times: "You're in good health.  Be patient with yourself, you will get it done.  Keep trying.  It's okay to fail, but don't give up trying.  Be patient.  No shortcuts. It's not about simply getting it done, but getting it done the right way."</p>

<p>What to do when you're feeling down at DBC?  I haven't been there yet, but being that the nature of the program is heavily exercising the mind, I believe taking breaks will be helpful.  Specifically, completely turn off what it is your doing.  Stop thinking about it. STOP! Go get some physical exercise.  Take a brisk walk.  Take a jog.  Stretch. Do something that will allow you to escape from any thoughts about what it is bringing you down.  Re-establish your <b>health</b> perhaps as I described it above. Be <b>patient</b> that you'll get through it. Then get back to it.  <b>Persistence</b>.</p>

<p>I'm not here to preach, but just sharing what works for me. For you readers looking for answers, I hope there is something useful/beneficial you can take away from this or even supporting some ideas you already had.  As I mentioned in my previous blog about stereotype threat, this is the fight we all need to fight.  Fight for your health. Fight for your values. Live your life by your design.</p>
