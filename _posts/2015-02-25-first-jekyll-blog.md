Jekyll should be awesome.  And this blog should show that.  The previous posts prior to this were transferred over from my old website.  Crossing my fingers that they appear decent. I hoping this will be the future home for my blog site and I can continue writing with comfort.

Look, I can write Ruby code:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

How about HTML code:
{% highlight html %}

<html>
  <title>el titulo</title>
</html>

{% endhighlight %}

How cool is that?!
