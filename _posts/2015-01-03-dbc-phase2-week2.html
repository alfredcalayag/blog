<p>Some reflection, Some things to look forward to.</p>
<p>It's been a crazy last couple of months wrapping up the end of 2014.  I completed Phase 1 at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">DBC</a> which further solidified my knowledge of Ruby fundamentals and also easing into databases, specifically ActiveRecord.  I would always look forward to Friday.  Every Friday we split into groups and would build an app from scratch... utilizing what we learned so far.  Those were the funnest days for me... getting creative, working with a group, and putting something to life.  The Friday experiences also helped me learn how cool my cohort-mates are.  Phase 1 was over, and looking forward to moving past console apps.</p>
<p>I bullet-trained straight into Phase 2 (turns out one weekend isn't much of a break between phases). This was gonna hurt. In the first 2 weeks I've completed so far, I've drowned a bit in completely new material. After our first day re-introduction to Javascript, we hit it hard with <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/">AJAX</a>, testing with <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>, Object Orientation in JS, MVC in JS, the Sinatra Framework, RESTful Routing, and much more.  Those 2 weeks have been the most frustrating in my learning experience.  I hit a lot of walls and it intensified my feelings of pressure under time.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, we had a 2 week break for the Christmas/New Year holiday.  To continue going hard or take it easy?  I would say I took the restful route. (Bad joke?) Yup, as the 2 weeks have come to an end, I've caught up on sleep (VERY IMPORTANT), got a little bit of Capoeira and Jiu-Jitsu in (but not enough to satisfy my heart's needs), and much needed QT with my wife, family, and friends.</p>
<p>Oh, and I struggled in completing my P5-P9 challenges early in the first week giving myself more time to dive more into my P10 challenge.  And... I took some courses on <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a> playing with Mobile Web Design, HTML5, CSS3, Angular, and looking forward to doing much more before the weekend is over. I took a bunch of their free intro courses, but quickly signed up after realizing that I learned effectively using their system.  I also skimmed the web for some advanced CSS examples and I am blown away.  I want to acquire that power!  I also want to resume blogging again as it helps me reflect and document some of the learning that I breeze by. So many things I want to do and not enough time. Ultimately, the learning never stopped during the 'break' and I'm super happy about that.</p>
<p>Lastly, can you tell that I'm excited?  About to enter Phase 2, Week 3 and up to this point I've learned that there is a lot more that I want to learn and have not touched.  Looking forward to seeing my cohort and teachers again on Monday.</p>
