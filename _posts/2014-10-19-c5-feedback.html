<p>Phase 0, Week 5</p>

<p>The food is only as good as the company you're with.  Have you ever heard that saying?  It makes sense to me.  You can spend top dollar and the finest restaurant, but if you're dining with people you find obnoxious... there's a negative placebo effect that gets seasoned on to your steak. (is it legit to dock off stars on Yelp because of that?).  On the same token, maybe you'll find that the fries at your favorite burger joint was super succulent that one night you celebrated your graduation at DBC with your best friends. (Or was it at 2am and did you have one too many beers?) Either way, the point I'm trying make is that the same goes for pair-programming.</p>

<p>I'm 5 weeks into the remote phase of this developer boot camp and that's 5 weeks of completing several pair-programming assignments with my cohort-mates. So far, I can say I have mixed feelings when it comes to pairing.  There have been some moments when pairing was fun, enjoyable, and educational. At the same time, I've had moments of frustration, struggling to stay within <a href="../gps1-2/gps1-2.html">driver and navigator</a> roles, and feeling like we're spending too much time on any one part of the assignment.  It's a mixed bag and here's why:</p>

<p>PROS:
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes 2 heads are better than one.  The challenges can be confusing and/or difficult.  With 2 minds attacking the problem, there's a higher probability that together we will overcome it.</li>
    <li>I can learn new approaches and techniques I would have not thought of myself.  OPEN YOUR MIND!</li>
    <li>I can learn more about someone in the process.  It has a social aspect to it, does it not?  Or are we 2 robots trying to deliver an output?  I've had enjoyable sessions where we've completed the work and we were able to engage on a personal level.  Remember?... the human side of it.  I'm not just here to learn how to code, I'm also here to network.  Arguably as equally important.  (Hint to my future pairs: I'm not a robot.)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>CONS:
  <ul>
    <li>Different experience levels.  Sometimes I'm more knowledgeable in a subject.  Sometimes it's the other way around.  And sometimes it's just not a easy combination to deal with when trying to complete a challenge collaboratively.  One can feel pressure to slow down the pace.  One can feel the heat to speed up.</li>
    <li>Staying within the defined roles can be a challenge on top of the challenge.  Are you <a href="../gps1-2/gps1-2.html">driving or navigating</a>? because it looks like you're doing both.  It can be very tempting sometimes to takeover the keyboard only to have to spend more time re-defining the roles.</li>
    <li>Twice the resources, twice the cost?  Time that is.  Some things I feel can be done faster if done alone. As simple as that.</li>
    <li>Communication Technology.  Facetime, Skype, Google Hangout. etc. When working, it works and it can work well.  When it's not... you need to start praying for patience.</li>
    <li>Personality clashes.  I haven't experienced this one in the context of pair-programming, but I can very well imagine that this would make up for a painful experience.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Whether or not we both have the same or opposing approaches to the challenge.  Whether or not the challenge was easily solved or very difficult to the point where we both get stuck.  Whatever the situation, I believe the pairing session is only as good as who you're pairing with.  For me and my personality, I feel I work best with people who are respectful, playful and likes to joke around a bit, committed to the assignment and collaborative effort, mindful of the pace of the parter, and communicates well and honestly.  That, to me, makes for a fun time... and ultimately that's my goal, having fun doing work and it doesn't feel like work.  I'm just here doing something I enjoy doing.</p>


<p>As part of the pair-programming process, we always give feedback to our pair after the session is completed, and at the same time, we receive feedback.  I'm always curious to read about what others think about how I work with them. It's nice to hear that someone felt they generally had a "great session", but really... what value does that kind of response have (other than boosting my ego)?

<b>A.S.K. - Actionable, Specific, and Kind</b>
I'm now a believer of these 3 ingredients when it comes to giving or receiving <b>USEFUL</b> feedback.  Whether the feedback is positive or negative.. *ahem* CONSTRUCTIVE, what makes all the difference is if it is real, honest, and specific.  "I had a great session with you". Great. Now what? Maybe you had a horrible time with me... "Worst person to pair with."  While that's never a desired thing to hear about myself these comments are still not specific.  What did I do to make the session 'great'?  What did I do to be the worst person to pair with?  In either case, the specifics are key in telling me what is working and to keep doing it, or what's not so awesome and to improve.  Additionally, it needs to be actionable... meaning is there clearly something I can do to improve?  In my 5 weeks worth of feedback from my peers, while majorly positive, about only half of them have touched on specificity. (is that even a word?).  I'm not perfect (except to my wife) so I know I have much room for improvement.  Ideally, I want to be conscious and doing better and better at each pairing session, but to help me realize those areas the feedback must be specific and actionable.</p>

<p> On the same token, I am guilty of this too when writing feedback to my peers.  It's actually not as easy as I thought to consistently hit these 3 points.  Especially when you do have an 'awesome' session and have nothing but positive things to say, I find myself struggling to think of constructive comments that are A.S.K.  So what do you write? And I'm not gonna start picking on little things just because there's nothing else better I can think of...that is a complete waste and I'm taking out the trash.  Doing something just cause... ugh.. don't get me started.  This is probably the most difficulties I'm having when giving feedback.  That and... maybe not writing the feedback soon after completing the pairing session =X ...waiting too long and then I forget some details.  I guess a good session is a memorable one that would be immune to this.</p>

<p>To sum it all up, I have found pairing and feedback to beneficial.  With the right people and done the right way, together we can do some damage and laugh the whole way through. Mu ha ha ha... #evillaugh #Halloweeniscoming #getintothespirit</p>
