<p>Phase 0, Week 1</p>

<p>I've always seen DBC as having a holistic approach in focusing on both mind and body health.In watching the fireside chat video, I like how Shereef explains that DBC is more of a Table mindset vs. a Kitchen mindset.  I'm well aware that my education is in my own hands.  It's going to be tough and results will not simply be given to me just because I paid my tuition.</p>

<p>I also liked hearing that students are accepted into the program based on the perceived ambition.  This resonated well with me in a saying I learned in jiu jitsu which is "hard work beats talent".  With the right attitude and positive mindset, you don't have to be a natural at this stuff in order to succeed.  For that reason, I'm very excited to be in this kind of learning environment and looking forward to meeting a lot of new cool people.  I'm gonna have a great time.</p>
